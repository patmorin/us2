  A \defin{unique-superior colouring} (also known as a \defin{$2$-vertex-ranking} or \defin{restricted star colouring}) is a mapping $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ to integer colours so that for any edge $uv$, $\varphi(u)\neq \varphi(v)$ and for any $3$-vertex path $uvw$, $\phi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ or $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$.  For a graph $G$, the \defin{unique-superior chromatic number} $\trn(G)$ is the minimum value of $k$ such that $G$ has a unique-superior colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$.  We show that there exists a constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has $\trn(G) \le cd^{4/3}(n\log n)^{1/3}$.  This almost matches the lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ for $2$-degenerate graphs and significantly improves the previous upper bound of $O(\sqrt{dn})$ for $d$-degenerate graphs---both given by \citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on}. These results extend to the \defin{$\ell$-vertex-ranking} problem in which one considers all paths $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ of length $r\le \ell$ and requires that $\varphi(v_0)\neq\varphi(v_r)$ or that $\varphi(v_0)<\max\{\varphi(v_1),\ldots,\varphi(v_{r-1})\}$.  In this setting, for any fixed $\ell$ and $d$, the bound on the $\ell$-vertex-ranking number $\lrn(G)$ for any $d$-degenerate graph $G$ is $O(n^{(\ell-3/2)/(\ell-1/2)}\log n)$.

\section{Introduction}

A \defin{unique-superior colouring} (also known as a \defin{$2$-vertex-ranking} or \defin{restricted star colouring}) is a mapping $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of the vertices of a graph $G$ to integer colours so that for any edge $uv$, $\varphi(u)\neq \varphi(v)$ and for any $3$-vertex path $uvw$, $\varphi(u)\neq\varphi(w)$ or $\varphi(v)>\varphi(u)$.  For a graph $G$, the unique-superior chromatic number $\trn(G)$ is the minimum value of $k$ such that $G$ has a unique-superior colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$.

\citet{karpas.neiman.ea:on}  showed that for every $d$-degenerate\footnote{A graph $G$ is \defin{$d$-degenerate} if every non-empty subgraph of $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $d$.  Equivalently, $G$ is $d$-degenerate if it has a vertex ordering in which each vertex precedes at most $d$ of its neighbours in the ordering.} $n$-vertex graph $G$, $\trn(G)\in O(\sqrt{dn})$ and that there exists $2$-degenerate $n$-vertex graphs with $\trn(G)\in\Omega(n^{1/3})$.\footnote{In \cite[Theorem~6.2]{karpas.neiman.ea:on} the authors prove the bound $O(d\sqrt{n})$, but an easy optimization of their argument (separately colouring all vertices of degree greater than $\sqrt{n/d}$ with distinct large colours) improves this to $O(\sqrt{dn})$.}  They leave the question of closing the gap between these bounds as an open problem and this question is stated again by \citet{bose.dujmovic.ea:asymptotically}.
In the current paper we give a colouring procedure that essentially matches their lower bound to within a polylogarithmic factor.  In particular, for fixed $d$, $\trn(G)\in O((n\log n)^{1/3})$.

\begin{thm}\label{d_degenerate_upper_bound}
  There exists a constant $c>0$ such that for any integer $d\ge 1$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has $\trn(G) \le c d^{4/3}(n\log n)^{1/3}$.
\end{thm}

Like the upper bound in \cite{karpas.neiman.ea:on}, \cref{d_degenerate_upper_bound} follows quickly from a theorem about graphs that are both $d$-degenerate and have maximum-degree $\Delta$. For such graphs, we prove:

\begin{thm}\label{degenerate_and_degree}
  There exists a constant $c>0$ such that
  for all integers $\Delta\ge d \ge 1$, and $n> \Delta$, every $d$-degenerate $n$-vertex graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has
  $\trn(G)\leq cd^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{3/2} n$.
\end{thm}

\Cref{d_degenerate_upper_bound} follows easily from \cref{degenerate_and_degree}, by the following argument:  Since $G$ is $d$-degenerate, it has at most $dn$ edges and the sum of its vertex degrees is at most $2dn$.  Let $\Delta:=d^{-1/3}n^{2/3}\log^{-1/3} n$.  Then the set $S:=\{v\in V(G):\deg_G(v)\ge \Delta\}$ has size at most $2dn/\Delta=2d^{4/3}n^{1/3}\log^{1/3} n$.  Since $G-S$ has maximum degree $\Delta$, $G-S$ has a unique-superior colouring $\varphi$ using at most
\[
  cd^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1/2} n
  % = c\cdot \sqrt{\frac{n^{2/3}}{d^{1/3}\log^{1/2} n}}\cdot \log^{3/4} n
  = c d^{\tfrac{3}{2}-\tfrac{1}{6}}n^{\tfrac{1}{3}}\log^{\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{6}} n
  = c d^{\tfrac{4}{3}}(n\log n)^{\tfrac{1}{3}}
\]
colours, by \cref{degenerate_and_degree}. We can extend $\varphi$ to a colouring of $G$ by assigning each vertex in $S$ a distinct colour that is larger than every colour used in the colouring of $G-S$.  Thus, $\trn(G)\le |S|+\trn(G-S)\le (2+c)d^{4/3}(n\log n)^{1/3}$, which establishes \cref{d_degenerate_upper_bound}.

A vertex colouring $\varphi$ of $G$ is an \defin{$\ell$-vertex-ranking} of $G$ if, for each path $v_0,\ldots,v_r$ in $G$ with $1\le r\le\ell$ edges, $\varphi(v_0)\neq \varphi(v_r)$ or $\max\{\varphi(v_1),\ldots,\varphi(v_{r-1})\}>\varphi(v_0)$.  The \defin{$\ell$-vertex-ranking} number $\lrn(G)$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a vertex $\ell$-ranking $\varphi:V(G)\to\{1,\ldots,k\}$.  Note that $\varphi$ is a $2$-vertex ranking of $G$ if and only if it is a unique-superior colouring of $G$, so $\trn(G)=\rn{2}(G)$ for every graph $G$.  Using the same techniques, we establish the following upper bound for the $\ell$-vertex-ranking number of $d$-degenerate graphs:

\begin{thm}\label{l_d_degenerate_upper_bound}
  For all positive integers $d$ and $\ell$ there exists a constant $c:=c(d,\ell)$ such that, for every integer $n\ge d$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has
  \[
    \lrn(G)\le c n^{\frac{\ell-3/2}{\ell-1/2}}\log n \enspace .
  \]
\end{thm}
\todo[inline]{Does this look better?
\[ cn^{1-\frac{1}{\ell-1/2}}\log n \]
In text: $cn^{1-1/(\ell-1/2)}\log n$ versus $cn^{(\ell-3/2)/(\ell-1/2)}\log n$
}

In the next section, we prove \cref{degenerate_and_degree}.  In the subsequent section we sketch the modifications needed to prove \cref{l_degenerate_and_degree}, the $\ell$-vertex-ranking analogue of  \cref{degenerate_and_degree} and use this to establish \cref{l_d_degenerate_upper_bound}.



\section{The Proof}

For any standard graph-theoretic terminology and notation not defined here, we use the same conventions used in the textbook by \citet{diestel:graph}.  A graph $G$ has vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$.  For any $S\subseteq V(G)$, $G[S]$ denote the subgraph of $G$ induced by the vertices in $S$.  For any vertex $v$ of $G$, $N_G(v):=\{w:vw\in E(G)\}$ and $\deg_G(v):=|N_G(v)|$.  For an integer $\ell$, $G^\ell$ denotes the graph with vertex set $V(G)$ that contains an edge $vw$ if and only if some path in $G$ with at most $\ell$ edges contains $v$ and $w$.

For a directed graph $G$, we write $\overrightarrow{vw}$ to denote the directed edge with source $v$ and target $w$.  For a vertex $v$ in a directed graph $G$, $N^+_{G}(v):=\{w\in V(G):\overrightarrow{vw}\in E(G)\}$ denotes the set of out-neighbours of $v$ and $N^-_G(v):=\{u\in V(G):\overrightarrow{uv}\in E(G)\}$ denotes the set of in-neighbours of $v$, $\deg^+_{G}(v):=|N^+_G(v)|$ is the out-degree of $v$, and $\deg^-_{G}(v):=|N^-_G(v)|$ is the in-degree of $v$. We also define $N^+_{G}[v]:=\{v\}\cup N^+_{G}(v)$ and $N^-_{G}[v]:=\{v\}\cup N^-_{G}(v)$ to be the closed out- and in-neighbourhoods of $v$, respectively.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{degenerate_and_degree}]
  Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph of maximum-degree $\Delta$.  Let $S_0:=V(G)$ and, for each integer $i\ge 1$, let $S_i:=\{v\in S_{i-1}:\deg_{G[S_{i-1}]}(v)\ge 4d\}$.  Since $G$ is $d$-degenerate $G[S_{i-1}]$ has at most $d|S_{i-1}|$ edges.  Therefore $2d|S_{i-1}|\ge \sum_{v\in S_{i-1}} \deg_{G[S_{i-1}]}(v)\ge 4d|S_i|$, so $|S_i|\le |S_{i-1}|/2\le n/2^i$ for each $i\ge 1$.  Let $q$ be the maximum integer such that $S_i$ is non-empty.  Since $1\le |S_q|\le n/2^q$, $q\le \log_2 n$.  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$, let $L_i:=S_i\setminus S_{i+1}$.  (These notations are mnemonics: $S_i$ are the \defin{survivors} of round $i-1$ and $L_i$ is \defin{layer} $i$.)

  Let $a:=3/2$ and $b:=1/2$.  We compute our colouring using a two phase algorithm. In the first phase we use a sequence of pairwise-disjoint color palettes $\Phi_0,\ldots,\Phi_{q}$, each of size $2k:=2d^{a}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{b}n$, such that for each $1\le i < j\le k$, every colour in $\Phi_i$ is less than every colour in $\Phi_j$.  We will use the colours in $\Phi_i$ to colour the vertices in $L_i$, for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$.  The total number of colours used in this phase is $2k(q+1)\le 2k(1+\log n)= O(k\log n)$.

  We say that a vertex $y$ of $G$ is \defin{problematic} if $y$ has a neighbour in $G$ that receives the same colour as $y$ in the first phase or if $G$ contains a path $vyw$ such that $y\in L_i$, $u,w\in L_j$, $i \le j$ and $u$ and $w$ receive the same colour in the first phase. Note that any violation of the unique-superior colouring conditions is either an edge $yw$ with $\varphi(y)=\varphi(w)$ or a path $uyw$ with $\varphi(u)=\varphi(w)>\varphi(y)$.  In either case, the vertex $y$ is problematic and this violation could be fixed by recolouring $y$ with a sufficiently large colour, which is what the second phase of the algorithm does.

  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$, fix an arbitrary total order $<_i$ on the vertices of $L_i$. Define the total order $<$ on $V(G)$ in which $v <w$ if $v\in L_i$, $w\in L_j$, and $i<j$ or if $v,w\in L_i$ and $v<_iw$. Let $H$ be the directed acyclic graph obtained from $G^2$ by directing each edge $vw$ as $\overrightarrow{vw}$ so that $v<w$.  In the discussion that follows, we will use the directed graph notations $N^+_G(v)$ and $\deg^+_G(v)$.  When we do so, we are referring to the directed acyclic graph obtained by orienting each edge $vw$ of $G$ as $\overrightarrow{vw}$ so that $v<w$.

  First we observe that $\deg^+_G(v)< 4d$ for any vertex $v$ of $G$. Indeed, a vertex $v$ is contained in $L_i$ precisely because $\deg_{G[S_i]}(v)<4d$.  The bound on $\deg^+_G(v)$ then follows from the fact that $N^+_{G}(v)\subseteq N_{G[S_i]}(v)$.  Next we claim that for each vertex $v$ of $G$, $\deg^+_{H}(v)\le (4d-1)(2\Delta+1)$.  To see this, suppose $v\in L_i$ and consider some edge $\overrightarrow{vw}$ of $H$.  Then  $\overrightarrow{vw}$ is of one of the following types:
  \begin{compactenum}[(T1)]
    \item $vw\in E(G)$ and $v<w$. Edges of this type contribute at most $\deg^+_{G}(v)\le 4d-1$ to $\deg^+_{H}(v)$.
    \item $G$ contains a path $vyw$ with $y < v < w$ or $v < y < w$.  Since $\deg_G(v)\le\Delta$, there are at most $\Delta$ choices for $y$.  For each such $y$, $w\in N^+_G(y)$ (since $y<w$), so there are at most $4d-1$ choices for $w$.  Therefore, edges of this type contribute at most $(4d-1)\Delta$ to the out-degree of $v$.
    \item $G$ contains a path $vyw$ with $v < w < y$.  Since $v<y$, $y\in N_G^+(v)$, so there are at most $4d-1$ choices for $y$ and for each such $y$, $\deg_G(y)\le\Delta$, so there are at most $\Delta$ choices for $w$.  Therefore, edges of this type contribute at most $(4d-1)\Delta$ to the out-degree of $v$.
  \end{compactenum}
  In the first phase of colouring, we colour the vertices of $G$ in the order given by $<$.  Immediately before colouring some vertex $w\in L_i$ we count, for each colour $\alpha\in \Phi_i$, the number $N_\alpha(w)$ of neighbours $y\in N^-_G(w)$ such that $y$ has colour $\alpha$ or $y$ already has a neighbour $u$ of colour $\alpha$. Observe that $\sum_{\alpha\in \Phi_i} N_\alpha(w)\le 4d|N^-_G(w)|< 4d\Delta$ since there are at most $|N^-_G(w)|\le\Delta$ choices for $y$ and for each $y$ there are at most $4d-1$ choices for $u$.  (Since any $u$ coloured with $\alpha\in\Phi_i$ must be in $S_i$, the number of such $u$ is at most $|N_G(y)\cap S_i|\le 4d$, since $y < w$ and $w\in S_i$.)

  We choose the colour of $w$ uniformly at random from a subpalette of $\Phi_i$ that contains exactly half the colours in $\Phi_i$.  Specifically we choose from a palette $\Phi_w\subset \Phi_i$ that contains the $k$ colours $\alpha$ in $\Phi_i$ with the smallest $N_\alpha(w)$ values, so that  $\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\}\le\min\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in\Phi_i\setminus\Phi_w\}$.  Let $M:=4d\Delta/k$.  Then
  \[
    Mk = 4d\Delta \ge 4d|N^-_G(w)| \ge \sum_{\alpha\in \Phi_i} N_\alpha(w) \ge \sum_{\alpha\in\Phi_i\setminus\Phi_w}N_\alpha(w) \ge k\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\} \enspace ,
  \]
  so that $\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\}\le M$.  This completes the description of the first-phase colouring $\varphi$ of $G$.

  At this point, we can offer some justification for the definition of the colour set $\Phi_w$ that we choose from when colouring $w$. For each problematic vertex $y$, there exists a minimum vertex $w$ (with respect to $<$) such that $y$ becomes problematic precisely when $w$ is coloured.  When this happens, we say that $w$ \defin{completes} $y$. By definition, if $w$ chooses the colour $\alpha\in\Phi_w$, then it completes at most $N_{\alpha}(w)+1\le M$ vertices.  (The additional ${}+1$ here comes from the fact that $w$ can complete itself, which occurs when $w$ chooses the same colour as one of its neighbours.) Thus, $M$ is an upper bound on the number of problematic vertices that can be created by colouring any single vertex $w$.

  Let $P$ be the set of all problematic vertices in $G$.  In the second phase, we re-colour every vertex in $P$ with a colour in a palette $\Phi_{q+1}$ of size $ck\log n + 1$ whose colours are all larger than all colours in $\Phi_0,\ldots,\Phi_q$.  Since we are recolouring vertices in $P$ with large colours in $\Phi_{q+1}$, any violations of the unique-superior colouring conditions after the second phase must be caused by paths (with two or three vertices) whose endpoints are in $P$ and that receive the same colour.  In order to avoid these we will properly colour $G^2[P]$.  To show that this is possible, we will prove that, with positive probability, after the first phase, the maximum out-degree of any vertex in $H[P]$ is at most $ck\log n$.  Therefore there is some assignment of colours in phase one in which the maximum out-degree of $H[P]$ is at most $ck\log n$.  Therefore $H[P]$ is an acyclic orientation of $G^2[P]$ with maximum out-degree $ck\log n$, so $G^2[P]$ is $(ck\log n)$-degenerate.  Therefore, the $ck\log n + 1$ colours in $\Phi_{q+1}$ are sufficient to properly colour $G^2[P]$.

  We now focus on an arbitrary vertex $p$ in $G$ and show that after the first phase, $|N^+_{H}(p)\cap P|\le ck\log n$ with probability $1-n^{-\Omega(c)}$.  The union bound then implies that, with probability $1-n^{-\Omega(c)}$, $|N^+_{H}[p]\cap P|\le ck\log n$ for every $p\in V(G)$.  Since $P\subseteq V(G)$, this implies that, with probability $1-n^{-\Omega(c)}$, the maximum out-degree in $H[P]$ is at most $ck\log n$.
  % In particular, it implies that there exists a colouring of $G$ using the $O(k\log n)$ colours in $\Phi_0,\ldots,\Phi_q$ with this property.

  Fix an arbitrary vertex $p$ of $G$ and suppose $p\in L_i$. We are interested in the number of problematic vertices in $N_H^+(p)$.  Let $C_p:=\bigcup_{y\in N^+_H(p)} N^+_G[y]$, which is the set of all vertices $w$ that could complete some vertex $y\in N^+_H(p)$. For each $w\in C_p$, let
  $C_{p,w}:=N_H^+(p)\cap N_G^-[w]$, which is the set of vertices in $N^+_{H}(p)$ that $w$ could potentially complete. For each $w\in C_p$, let $\comp(p,w):=\{y\in C_{p,w}:\text{$w$ completes $y$}\}$.  For each $\alpha\in\Phi_w$, let $\comp'_\alpha(p,w)$ contain exactly those vertices $y\in C_{p,w}$ that have colour $\alpha$ or have a neighbour of colour $\alpha$ immediately before choosing the colour of $w$.  Observe that $\comp'_\alpha(p,w)$ contains every $y\in C_{p,w}$ that would be completed by $w$ if we were to set the colour of $w$ to $\alpha$ (as well as some additional vertices that may have already been completed by vertices in $C_p$ that were coloured before $w$).

  Recall that $N_\alpha(w)$ counts the number of neighbours $y$ of $w$ such that $y < w$ and $y$ has colour $\alpha$ or has a neighbour of colour $\alpha$ immediately before we choose the colour of $w$.  Therefore,  $|\comp'_\alpha(p,w)|\le N_\alpha(w)+1\le M$ for each $\alpha\in\Phi_w$.  Now let $\alpha\in\Phi_w$ be the colour that is actually chosen for $w$ and let $\comp'(p,w):=\comp'_\alpha(p,w)$.  We want to study the random variable $X'_{p,w}:=|\comp'(p,w)|\ge |\comp(p,w)|$.  Since $\alpha$ is chosen from $\Phi_w$, $X'_{p,w} \le M$.

  Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_t$ be the colours in $\Phi_w$ ordered so that,
  \[
    |\comp'_{\alpha_1}(p,w)|\ge|\comp'_{\alpha_2}(p,w)|\ge\cdots\ge |\comp'_{\alpha_t}(p,w)| \enspace .
  \]
  Immediately before colouring $w\in L_i$, each $y\in C_{p,w}$ is assigned a colour (possibly in $\Phi_i$) and has at most $4d-2$ neighbours that have already received a colour in $\Phi_i$.  Therefore, $y$ appears in
  $\comp'_{\alpha}(p,w)$ for at most $4d-1$ values of $\alpha$, so
  \[
    \sum_{\alpha\in\Phi_w} |\comp'_{\alpha}(p,w)| \le 4d| C_{p,w}| \enspace .
  \]
  Therefore $i|\comp'_{\alpha_i}(p,w)|\le\sum_{j=1}^i|\comp'_{\alpha_j}(p,w)|\le 4d|C_{p,w}|$, so
  \[
    |\comp'_{\alpha_i}(p,w)|\le \frac{4d|C_{p,w}|}{i} \enspace .
  \]
  Therefore, regardless of any random choices made before choosing the colour of $w$ and any random choices made after choosing the colour of $w$, the random variable $X'_{p,w}$ is dominated by a random variable $X_{p,w}:=\min\{4d|C_{p,w}|/j,M\}$ where $j$ is chosen uniformly in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$.

  Therefore, $|N_H^+(p)\cap P|$ is dominated by a sum $X_p:=\sum_{w\in C_p} X_{p,w}$ of independent random variables.  We would like to apply a concentration result to the random variable $X$.  For this, we need to  establish sufficiently strong properties on the individual terms $X_{p,w}$, $w\in C_p$.  Thus far, we know that $0\le X_{p,w}\le M$ for each $w\in C_p$. In the appendix, we bound the expectation and variance of each $X_{p,w}$ so that we can apply a Bernstein Inequality to prove that $\Pr(X\ge ck\log n)\le n^{-\Omega(c)}$.  Thus, the number of additional colours in $\Phi_{q+1}$ needed to recolour $P$ in the second phase is $O(k\log n)$.  Thus, In this way, the total number of colours used is $O(k\log n)$, so
  \[
    \trn(G) \le O(k \log n) = O(d^a\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1+b} n) = O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{3/2} n) \enspace . \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}


\section{Generalization to \boldmath$\ell$-Vertex-Ranking}

We repeatedly make use of the following foklore result:

\begin{obs}\label{orientation_to_degeneracy}
  If an undirected graph $G$ has an orientation in which each vertex has maximum out-degree $d$, then $G$ is $2d$-degenerate.
\end{obs}

\begin{proof}
  For any $S\subseteq V(G)$, using the same orientation shows that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has an orientation in which each vertex is the source of at most $d$ edges.  This implies that $G[S]$ contains at most $d|S|$ edges and therefore the total degree of all vertices in $G[S]$ is at most $2d|S|$.  Therefore, for any $S\subseteq V(G)$, the induced graph $G[S]$ has a vertex of degree at most $2d$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Cheap Tricks}

\begin{lem}\label{cairns_trick}
  For any integers $\ell\ge 1$, $d\ge 1$, $\Delta\ge d$, and any $d$-degenerate graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the graph $G^{\ell}$ is $2^{\ell+2} d^{\lceil\ell/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}$-degenerate.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $<$ be a $d$-degenerate ordering of $V(G)$, so that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours that precede it in the order.  For each edge $vw$ of $G^{\ell}$, select some path $\Pi_{vw}:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $G$ with endpoints $x_0:=v$ and $x_r:=w$ and having $r\le\ell$ edges.  Say that an edge $x_ix_{i+1}$ of $\Pi_{vw}$ is a \defin{downstream} edge of $\Pi_{vw}$ if $x_i < x_{i+1}$, otherwise it is an \defin{upstream} edge.  Consider the following orientation of $G^\ell$.  For each edge $vw$ of $G^\ell$, if at least half the edges of $\Pi_{vw}$ are downstream edges of $\Pi_{vw}$ then orient the edge $vw$ as $\overrightarrow{vw}$, otherwise orient it as $\overleftarrow{vw}$.

  We claim that the resulting orientation of $G^{\ell}$ has maximum out-degree at most $2^{\ell+1} d^{\lceil\ell/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}$.  To see this, consider a vertex $v$ and some edge $\overrightarrow{vw}$ that contributes to the out-degree of $v$.  Suppose that $\Pi_{vw}:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ has length $r\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}$. Given $v$, we can uniquely identify $\Pi_{vw}$ (and hence $w$) from the following description: We first specify a sequence of $r$ bits that describes which edges of $\Pi_{vw}$ are upstream and which are downstream.  Next, we specify $x_1,\ldots,x_r$.  We know that $x_0=v$. Given $x_i$ for some $i\in\{0,\ldots,r-1\}$, if $x_ix_{i+1}$ is a downstream edge then there are at most $d$ options for $x_{i+1}$.  If $x_ix_{i+1}$ is an upstream edge then there are at most $\Delta$ options for $x_{i+1}$.  For a given $r$, the number of such paths is therefore at most $2^rd^{\lceil r/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor r/2\rfloor}$, since at least half the edges of $\Pi_{vw}$ are downstream edges.  Summing over $r$ from $1$ to $\ell$ establishes the claim.  Therefore $G^{\ell}$ has an orientation in which each vertex has maximum out-degree $2^{\ell+1} d^{\lceil\ell/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}$.  By \cref{orientation_to_degeneracy}, $G^\ell$ is $2^{\ell+2} d^{\lceil\ell/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}$-degenerate.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{l_degenerate}
  For any integers $d\ge 2$ and $\ell\ge 2$ there exists a constant $c:=c(d,\ell)$ such that, for all integers $n\ge \Delta$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ has $\lrn(G)\le cn^{\ell/(\ell+2)}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  (Note that we may treat $d$ and $\ell$ as fixed, so that $n$ is only value that tends to infinity.)
  Let $\Delta:=n^{1/\lfloor 3\ell/2\rfloor}$ and let $S:=\{v\in V(G):\deg_G(v)\ge\Delta\}$.  Then $G-S$ is $d$-degenerate and has maximum-degree $\Delta$ so, by \cref{cairns_trick}, $(G-S)^{\ell}$ is $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor})$-degenerate and therefore has a proper colouring using $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor})=O(n^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor/\lfloor 3\ell/2\rfloor)})=O(n^{1-1/\lfloor 3\ell/2\rfloor})$ colours.  This extends to an $\ell$-vertex-ranking of $G$ by giving each vertex in $S$ a distinct colour that is larger than all vertices of $G-S$.  This requires an additional $|S|=O(n/\Delta)=n^{1-1/\lfloor 3\ell/2\rfloor})$ colours.

  To see that the resulting colouring is an $\ell$-vertex-ranking, consider some path $\Pi=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $G$ of length $r\le\ell$.  If $\Pi$ includes a vertex in $S$ then $\max\{\varphi(x):x\in S\cap \{x_0,\ldots,x_r\}\}$ is the largest colour is the unique maximum colour that appears in $\Pi$.  Otherwise, $\Pi$ is a path in $(G-S)^{\ell}$, in which case $\varphi(x_0)\neq\varphi(x_r)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Generalizing \cref{degenerate_and_degree}}

An \defin{undirected path} $\Pi$ in a graph $G$ is a connected subgraph of $G$ with exactly two vertices of degree $1$ and all other vertices of degree $2$.  The \defin{length} of $\Pi$ is the number of edges in $\Pi$, which is exactly one less than the number of vertices.  With a slight abuse of notation, we will write $x_0,\ldots,x_r$ to denote a length-$r$ undirected path $\Pi$ where $x_0$ and $x_r$ are degree-$1$ vertices of $\Pi$ and $\Pi$ contains the edge $x_{i-1}x_i$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$. We call $x_0$ and $x_r$ the \defin{endpoints} of $\Pi$.  For a graph $G$, let $\mathcal{P}_\ell(G)$ denote the set of all undirected paths of length at most $\ell$ in $G$.

\begin{lem}\label{advanced_cairns}
  For any integers $d\ge 2$, $\ell\ge 2$, $\Delta\ge d$ and any
  graph $G$ of maximum-degree $\Delta$ that has an orientation of maximum out-degree $d$ there exists a mapping $\rho:\mathcal{P}_\ell(G)\to V(G)$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item $\rho(P)$ is an endpoint of $P$ for each $P\in\mathcal{P}$; and
    \item $|\rho^{-1}(v)| \le 2^{\ell+1}d^{\ceil \ell/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}$ for each $v\in V(G)$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Consider some path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $G$ of length $r\le\ell$.  Say that an edge $x_ix_{i+1}$ of $\Pi$ is a \defin{downstream} edge of $\Pi$ if it is oriented away from $x_i$, otherwise it is an \defin{upstream} edge.  If at least half the edges of $\Pi$ are downstream edges of $\Pi_{vw}$ then set $\rho(\Pi):=x_0$, otherwise set $\rho(\Pi):=x_r$.

  Observe that for any path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r\in \rho^{-1}(x_0)$ can be uniquely reconstructed from the following information:
  \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
    \item A sequence $b_1,\ldots,b_r$ of $r$ bits, where $b_i=1$ if $x_{i-1}x_i$ is a downstream edge of $\Pi$ and $b_i=0$ if $x_{i-1}x_i$ is an upstream edge of $\Pi$.\label{bitstring}
    \item A sequence $\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_r$ of integers, where $\delta_i\in\{1,\ldots,d\}$ if $b_i=1$ and $\delta_i\in\{1,\ldots,\Delta\}$ if $b_i=0$.  The integer $\delta_i$ uniquely identifies the neighbour $x_i$ of $x_{i-1}$ so that, starting at $x_0$ we can uniquely reconstruct $\Pi$.\label{directions}
  \end{compactenum}
  The number of choices for (\ref{bitstring}) is $2^r$ and for any (\ref{bitstring}) with at least as many $1$-bits as $0$-bits, the number of choices for (\ref{directions}) is at most $d^{\lceil r/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor r/2\rfloor}$.  So the number of path of length $r$ in $\rho^{-1}(x_0)$ is at most $2^rd^{\lceil r/2\rceil}\Delta^{\lfloor r/2\rfloor}$.  Summing $r$ over $1$ to $\ell$ completes the proof.
\end{proof}

For a directed graph $G$ let $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}_\ell(G)$ denote the set of (not necessarily directed) paths $x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $G$ of length at most $r$ and such that $\overleftarrow{x_0x_1}$ is a directed edge of $G$ and $\overrighttarrow{x_{r-1}x_{r}}$ is also a directed edge of $G$.

\begin{lem}\label{advanced_cairns2}
  For any integers $d\ge 2$, $\ell\ge 3$, $\Delta\ge d$ and any
  directed graph $G$ of maximum-degree $\Delta$ and maximum out-degree $d$, there exists a mapping $\rho:\widehat{\mathcal{P}}_\ell(G)\to V(G)$ such that
  \begin{compactenum}[(i)]
    \item $\rho(\Pi)\in V(\Pi)$ for each $P\in\mathcal{P}$; and
    \item $|\rho^{-1}(v)| \le 2^{\ell+1}d^{\lceil \ell/2\rceil+1}\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1}$ for each $v\in V(G)$.
  \end{compactenum}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is almost identical to \cref{advanced_cairns2} except that, by assigning a path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ to one of $v_1$ or $v_{r-1}$ the number of options for describing the path becomes at most $2^{r-1}d^{\lceil r/2\rceil+1}\Delta^{\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1}$ for $r\ge 3$ (and at most $d^r$ for $r\in\{1,2\}$).
\end{proof}

For a vertex colouring $\varphi:V(G)\to\N$ of a graph $G$, we say that an undirected path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $G$ is an \defin{$\ell$-violation} of $\varphi$ if $\Pi$ has length $r\le\ell$ and $\varphi(x_0)=\varphi(x_r)=\max\{\varphi(x_0),\ldots,\varphi(x_r)\}$.  Observe that $\varphi$ is an $\ell$-vertex-ranking if and only if $G$ contains no $\ell$-violations of $\varphi$.

\begin{thm}\label{l_degenerate_and_degree}
  For any integers $d\ge 2$ and $\ell\ge 2$ there exists a constant $c:=c(d,\ell)$ such that, for all integers $\Delta\ge d$ and $n\ge \Delta$, every $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ has $\lrn(G)\le c\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1/2}\log n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
  Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex $d$-degenerate graph of maximum-degree $\Delta$.  Let $S_0:=V(G)$ and, for each integer $i\ge 1$, let $S_i:=\{v\in S_{i-1}:\deg_{G[S_{i-1}]}(v)\ge 4d\}$.  Since $G$ is $d$-degenerate $G[S_{i-1}]$ has at most $d|S_{i-1}|$ edges.  Therefore $2d|S_{i-1}|\ge \sum_{v\in S_{i-1}} \deg_{G[S_{i-1}]}(v)\ge 4d|S_i|$, so $|S_i|\le |S_{i-1}|/2\le n/2^i$ for each $i\ge 1$.  Let $q$ be the maximum integer such that $S_i$ is non-empty.  Since $1\le |S_q|\le n/2^q$, $q\le \log_2 n$.  For each $i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$, let $L_i:=S_i\setminus S_{i+1}$.  (These notations are mnemonics: $S_i$ are the \defin{survivors} of round $i-1$ and $L_i$ is \defin{layer} $i$.)

  Let $k:=\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1/2}$. We compute our colouring using a two phase algorithm. In the first phase we use a sequence of pairwise-disjoint color palettes $\Phi_0,\ldots,\Phi_{q}$, each of size $2k:=2d^{a}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{b}n$, such that for each $1\le i < j\le k$, every colour in $\Phi_i$ is less than every colour in $\Phi_j$.  We will use the colours in $\Phi_i$ to colour the vertices in $L_i$, for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$.  The total number of colours used in this phase is $2k(q+1)\le 2k(1+\log n)= O(k\log n)$.

  Let $\mathcal{P}$ contain all the undirected paths $x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $\mathcal{P}_{\ell}(G)$ such that $x_0$ and $x_r$ are in the same layer $L_j$ and $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{r-1}\}\subseteq \bigcup_{i=0}^j L_i$.  Let $\rho:\mathcal{P}\to V(G)$ be the mapping given by \cref{advanced_cairns}, applied to $G$ (and then restricted to the paths in $\mathcal{P}$).  We will say that a path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ in $\mathcal{P}$ is \defin{problematic} if $x_0$ and $x_r$ are assigned the same colour in the first phase of the algorithm.

  Although we have not yet completed the description of the first phase colouring, we already know enough to prove the following claim:  Any $\ell$-violation $\Pi$ of the first phase colouring is a problematic path in $\mathcal{P}$.  Indeed, if $\Pi=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ is an $\ell$-violation, $x_0$ and $x_r$ are assigned the same colour, so they must both be in $L_j$ for some $j\in\{0,\ldots,q\}$.  Furthermore the colour of $x_0$ is at least as large as any colour used on $x_1,\ldots,x_{r-1}$, so no colour in $\Phi_{j+1},\ldots,\Phi_q$ appears at any vertex in $x_1,\ldots,x_{r-1}$.  Therefore, $\{x_1,\ldots,x_{r-1}\}\subseteq L_0\cup\cdots\cup L_j$.  Therefore $\Pi\in\mathcal{P}$.  Since $x_0$ and $x_r$ have the same colour, $\Pi$ is problematic.

  We now describe the first phase colouring algorithm.  Consider the multigraph $G^*$ that, for each $vw\in V(G)$ contains as many copies of the edge $vw$ as there are undirected paths in $\mathcal{P}$ with endpoints $v$ and $w$.  The existence of $\rho$ implies that $G^*$ has an orientation in which each edge has out-degree $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2})$.  By \cref{orientation_to_degeneracy}, $G^*$ is $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2})$-degenerate.  Label the vertices of $G$ as $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ so that $v_i$ has degree $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2})$ in $G^*[\{v_1,\ldots,v_{i}\}]$.

  Let $\tau:\mathcal{P}\to V(G)$ be the mapping that maps $\Pi\in\mathcal{P}$ to $v_j$ if and only if the endpoints of $\Pi$ are $v_i$ and $v_j$ and $i < j$.\footnote{The two mappings $\tau$ and $\rho$ are similar. The difference is that $\rho$ corresponds to some orientation of $G^*$ and $\tau$ corresponds to an acyclic orientation of $G^*$.}  Consider some vertex $w\in L_j$.  For each $\alpha \in \Phi_j$, let $N_{\alpha}(w)$ be the number of paths in $\tau^{-1}(w)$ whose other endpoint (not $w$) is assigned the colour $\alpha$. If $w=v_j$ then $N_{\alpha}(w)$ is completely determined by the colours of $v_1,\ldots,v_{j-1}$.  If $w$ is assigned the colour $\alpha$ then exactly $N_{\alpha}(w)$ paths in $\tau^{-1}(w)$ will become problematic.  Therefore, $\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi_i} N_\alpha(w)=|\tau^{-1}(w)|=O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2\rfloor})$.

  We choose the colour of $w$ uniformly at random from a subpalette of $\Phi_i$ that contains exactly half the colours in $\Phi_i$.  Specifically we choose from a palette $\Phi_w\subset \Phi_i$ that contains the $k$ colours $\alpha$ in $\Phi_i$ with the smallest $N_\alpha(w)$ values, so that  $\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\}\le\min\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in\Phi_i\setminus\Phi_w\}$.  Let $M:=c\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}/k$.
  Then
  \[
    Mk = c\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor} \ge \sum_{\alpha\in \Phi_i} N_\alpha(w) \ge \sum_{\alpha\in\Phi_i\setminus\Phi_w}N_\alpha(w) \ge k\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\} \enspace ,
  \]
  so that $\max\{N_\alpha(w):\alpha\in \Phi_w\}\le M$.  This completes the description of the first-phase colouring $\varphi$ of $G$.

  % As before, we choose $\Phi_w\subseteq\Phi_i$ of size $k$ so that $N_\alpha(w)=O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2\rfloor}/k)$ for all $\alpha\in\Phi_w$. Let $M:=c\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2\rfloor}/k$ where $c$ is large enough that $N_\alpha(w)\le M$ for all $w\in V(G)$ and all $\alpha\in \Phi_w$. In the first phase, we choose the colour of $w$ uniformly from $\Phi_w$.  This completes the description of the first phase colouring algorithm.

  The first phase colouring $\varphi$ is not yet an $\ell$-vertex-ranking.  Our goal now is to study the $\ell$-violations of $\varphi$.  For each $\ell$-violation $\Pi$, we will choose a vertex $y$ of $\Pi$ to recolour in the second round, in order to eliminate this $\ell$-violation.  Consider the directed graph $G'$ obtained from $G$ by adding each edge $\overrightarrow{vw}$ if $vw\in E(G)$, $v\in L_i$, $w\in L_j$ and $i\le j$.  Then $G'$ has maximum out-degree $4d$ and $\widehat{\mathcal{P}}_\ell(G')$ contains $\mathcal{P}$. Let $\gamma:\mathcal{P}\to V(G)$ be the result of applying \cref{advanced_cairns2} to $G'$ (and then restricting it to the paths in $\mathcal{P}$.)

  Consider a problematic path $\Pi:=x_0,\ldots,x_r$ and suppose, without loss of generality that $\tau(\Pi)=x_0$.  Then $x_r$ was coloured before $x_0$ and $\Pi$ became problematic precisely when $x_0$ was coloured.  When this happens we say that the vertex $y:=\gamma(\Pi)$ is \defin{problematic} and we say that $x_0$ \defin{completes} $y$. Note that a vertex $y$ may be completed more than once. Indeed, any path in $\gamma^{-1}(y)$ could complete $y$. Note that it is also not required that $\Pi$ be an $\ell$-violation of $\varphi$.  However, for every $\ell$-violation $\Pi$ of $\varphi$, $\Pi$ is problematic, so $\gamma(\Pi)$ is defined.

  Let $P$ be the set of all problematic vertices.  By definition, every $\ell$-violation of $\varhpi$ contains at least one vertex in $P$.  In the second phase, we re-colour every vertex in $P$ with a colour in a palette $\Phi_{q+1}$ of size $ck\log n + 1$ whose colours are all larger than all colours in $\Phi_0,\ldots,\Phi_q$.  Since each $\ell$-violation of $\varphi$ contains a vertex in $P$, this recolouring eliminates all $\ell$-violations in $\varphi$.  More precisely, after this recolouring any remaining $\ell$-violation must have endpoints whose colour is in $\Phi_{q+1}$.  In order to avoid this, we will ensure that our recolouring is a proper colouring of $G^\ell[P]$.

  Observe that, for each edge $vw$of $G^\ell$,  graph with vertex set $V(G)$ that, for each undirected path $\Pi\in\mathcal{P}_\ell(G)$ contains the edge between the endpoints of $\Pi$.  By \cref{advanced_cairns,orientation_to_degeneracy}, $H$ is $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2\rfloor})$-degenerate.  Treat $H$ as a directed acyclic graph where each vertex has out-degree $O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell /2\rfloor})$.  Let $p$ be an arbitrary vertex of $G$.  We want to study the random variable $X_p$ that counts the number of problematic vertices in $N_H^+(p)$.

  Suppose that some $y\in N^+_H(p)$ is problematic.  This occurs when some vertex $w$ (an endpoint of some path in $\gamma^{-1}(y)$).  For each $y\in N^+_H(p)$ let $A_y$ be the set of endpoints of paths in $\gamma^{-1}(y)$ that could complete $y$.  Let $C_p:=\bigcup_{y\in N^+H(p)} A_y$ and, for each $w\in C_p$, let $C_{p,w}:=N^+_H(p)\cap \{\gamma(\Pi):\Pi\in\tau^{-1}(w)\}$.  In words, $C_p$ is the set of vertices $w$ that could complete some vertex $y\in N^+_H(p)$ and $C_{p,w}$ is the set of vertices in $N^+_H(p)$ that $w$ could complete some vertex $y\in C_p$.  Then
  \[
    \sum_{y\in N_H^+(p)} |\gamma^{-1}(y)| \le |N_H^+(p)|\cdot O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}-1) \le O(\Delta^{2\lfloor \ell/2\rfloor-1}) \enspace .
  \]

  \todo[inline]{What comes next is copy-pasted from the proof of \cref{degenerate_and_degree}.}

  For each $w\in C_p$, let $\comp(p,w):=\{y\in C_{p,w}:\text{$w$ completes $y$}\}$.  For each $\alpha\in\Phi_w$, let $\comp_\alpha(p,w)$ contain exactly those vertices $y\in C_{p,w}$ that would be completed by $w$ if we were to set the colour of $w$ to $\alpha$.  By definition $N_\alpha(w)\le |\comp_\alpha(p,w)|\le N_\alpha(w)\le M$.  We want to study the random variable $X'_{p,w}:=|\comp(p,w)|$.  Since $\alpha$ is chosen from $\Phi_w$, $X_{p,w} \le M$.

  Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_t$ be the colours in $\Phi_w$ ordered so that,
  \[
    |\comp'_{\alpha_1}(p,w)|\ge|\comp'_{\alpha_2}(p,w)|\ge\cdots\ge |\comp'_{\alpha_t}(p,w)| \enspace .
  \]
  For each $y\in N^+_H(p)$ and each path $\Pi\in \gamma^{-1}(y)\cap \tau^{-1}(w)$, there is at most one choice of colour $\alpha$ for $w$ that makes $\Pi$ problematic.  Therefore, $y$ appears in $\comp_\alpha(p,w)$ for at most $|\gamma^{-1}(y)|= O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}-1)$ values of $\alpha$, so
  \[
    \sum_{\alpha\in\Phi_w} |\comp_{\alpha}(p,w)| \le O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1})\cdot |C_{p,w}| \enspace .
  \]
  Therefore $i|\comp_{\alpha_i}(p,w)|\le\sum_{j=1}^i|\comp_{\alpha_j}(p,w)|\le O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor}-1)|C_{p,w}|$, so
  \[
    |\comp_{\alpha_i}(p,w)|\le \frac{O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1})|C_{p,w}|}{i} \enspace .
  \]
  Therefore, regardless of any random choices made before choosing the colour of $w$ and any random choices made after choosing the colour of $w$, the random variable $X'_{p,w}$ is dominated by a random variable $X_{p,w}:=\min\{O(\Delta^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor-1})|C_{p,w}|/j,M\}$ where $j$ is chosen uniformly in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$.

  Therefore, $|N_H^+(p)\cap P|$ is dominated by a sum $X_p:=\sum_{w\in C_p} X_{p,w}$ of independent random variables.  We would like to apply a concentration result to the random variable $X$.  For this, we need to  establish sufficiently strong properties on the individual terms $X_{p,w}$, $w\in C_p$.  Thus far, we know that $0\le X_{p,w}\le M$ for each $w\in C_p$. In the appendix, we bound the expectation and variance of each $X_{p,w}$ so that we can apply a Bernstein Inequality to prove that $\Pr(X\ge ck\log n)\le n^{-\Omega(c)}$.  Thus, the number of additional colours in $\Phi_{q+1}$ needed to recolour $P$ in the second phase is $O(k\log n)$.  Thus, In this way, the total number of colours used is $O(k\log n)$, so
  \[
    \trn(G) \le O(k \log n) = O(d^a\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1+b} n) = O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{3/2} n) \enspace . \qedhere
  \]

%
%   Now, define $H$ as the oriented version of $G^{\ell}$ where the orientation of each edge is given by $<$.  As before, consider an oriented version of $G$ with orientations also given by $<$.  Observe that, for every directed edge $\overrightarrow{py}$ of $H$, $G$ contains a (undirected) path of length at most $\ell$ that begins at $p$, ends at $y$, and traverses at least one edge of $G$ in the direction it is oriented.  The number of such paths is $O(\Delta^{\ell-1})$.  (Here and throughout this proof, $d$ and $\ell$ are fixed, so factors that depend only on $d$ and $\ell$ do not appear in asymptotic notations.)
%
%   A vertex $y\in L_i$ is \defin{problematic} if, after the first phase, there exist a path $\Pi$ of length at most $\ell$ that begins at a vertex $u\in L_j$, $j\ge i$, contains $y$, ends at a vertex $w\in L_j$ that receives the same colour as $u$.  (This includes the possibility that $u=y$.)  Consider the number of paths $\Pi$ that could result in $y$ being problematic. Any such $\Pi$ is the union of two paths $y\rightsquigarrow u$ and $y\rightsquigarrow w$ of lengths $a$ and $b$, respectively, where $0\le a\le b$ and $1\le a+b\le\ell$. The fact that $y\in L_i$ and $u,w\in L_j$ implies that, for fixed $y$ and fixed $a$ and $b$, the number of such paths $\Pi$ is at most $O(\Delta^{a-1}\cdot\Delta^{b-1})=O(\Delta^{\ell-2})$. The number of ways of fixing $1\le a\le b\le \ell$ depends only on $\ell$.  Thus, for any given $y$ the number of paths that could cause $y$ to become problematic is $O(\Delta^{\ell-2})$.
%
%
%   When colouring a vertex $w\in L_j$ we choose the colour of $w$ randomly from a $k$-colour subpalette $\Phi_w\subseteq \Phi_i$ chosen to minimize the maximum number $M$ of vertices $y$ that could become problematic by choosing $\varphi(w)\in \Phi_w$.  If $w\in L_j$, then each such $y$ is in $\bigcup_{i=0}^{j} L_i$, and is contained in a path of length at most $\ell$ that begins at $u\in L_j$, contains $y$ and ends at $w\in L_j$.  For a fixed $w$, the number of such paths is $O(\Delta^{\ell-1})$. For each such path $\Pi$, there is at most one colour $\alpha$ (the colour assigned to $u$) such that assigning the colour $\alpha$ to $w$ makes $y$ problematic because of $\Pi$.  This implies that $Mk \le O(\Delta^{\ell-1})$, so $M\le O(\Delta^{\ell-1}/k)=O(\sqrt{\Delta})$.
%
%   To upper bound the maximum out-degree in $H$, we fix some vertex $p$ and study the random variable $X_p:=|N^+_H(p)\cap P|$ where $P$ is the set of problematic vertices after the first phase.  Then $X_p$ is a sum of random variables $\sum_{w>p} X'_{p,w}$ where $X'_{p,w}$ is the number of vertices in $N^+_H(p)$ that become problematic precisely when $w$ is coloured.  For $w\in L_j$, $X'_{p,w}$ is dominated by a random variable $X_{p,w}$ that is distributed like $\min\{M,x_w/r\}$ where $r$ is uniform in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and $x_w$ counts the number of paths of length at most $\ell$ that begin at some vertex $u\in L_j$, contain some vertex $y\in N^+_H(p)\cap \bigcup_{i=1}^j L_j$ and end at $w\in L_j$.
%   We can upper bound $\sum_{w>p} x_w$ by summing over $y\in N^+_H(p)$, since each path that contributes to $x_w$ contains some $y\in N_H^+(p)$.  As discussed above, for each $y\in N^+_H(p)$, the number of such paths is $O(\Delta^{\ell-2})$.
%   Therefore, $\sum_{w>p} x_w\le |N^+_H(p)|\cdot O(\Delta^{\ell-2})=O(\Delta^{2\ell-3})$.  Therefore, the random varable $X_p$ is dominated by $X:=\sum_{w>p} X_{p,w}$. The same calculation used in the appendix then shows that
%   \[
%     \E(X) \le O\left(\frac{\Delta^{2\ell-3}\log n}{k}\right)
%     = O\left(\frac{\Delta^{2\ell-3}\log n}{\Delta^{\ell-3/2}}\right)
%     =  O\left(\Delta^{\ell-3/2}\log n\right)=O(k\log n) \enspace .
%   \]
%   More calculations almost identical to those that appear in the appendix show that $\Pr(X_p)\ge ck\log n=n^{-\Omega(c)}$.  Thus, with high probability, the graph $G^{\ell}[P]$ is $O(k\log n)$-degenerate so the vertices in $P$ can be re-coloured using an additional $O(k\log n)$ colours.
\end{proof}
%
% Unfortunately, \cref{l_degenerate_and_degree} is not strong enough to improve \cref{l_degenerate} for $\ell\ge 3$.  Indeed, using \cref{l_degenerate_and_degree} and the usual trick of colouring high-degree vertices with distinct colours only gives  $\trn(G)\le O(n^{(\ell-3/2)/(\ell-1/2)})$, which is worse than the bound in \cref{l_degenerate} for all $\ell\ge 3$.

\section{Bounding the Tail of \boldmath$|N_H^+(v)|$}

We make use of the following inequality of Bernstein \cite[Corollary~2.11]{boucheron.lugosi.ea:concentration}:

\begin{thm}\label{bernstein_theorem}
  Let $M$ be a positive number, let $X_1,\ldots,X_r$ be independent random variables such that $0\le X_i\le M$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$, and let $X:=\sum_{i=1}^r X_i$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \Pr\left(X \ge \E(X)+ t\right)
      \le \exp\left(\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^r \E((X_i-\E(X_i))^2)+\tfrac{1}{3}Mt}\right) \enspace . \label{bernstein}
  \end{equation}
\end{thm}
We will apply \cref{bernstein_theorem} to a random variable $X:=\sum_{i=1}^r X_i$ in which each $X_i$ has the following distribution (for some $0\le x_i\le kM$):
\[
  X_i = \begin{cases}
          M & \text{with probability $(1/k)\lfloor x_1/M\rfloor$} \\
          x_i/j & \text{with probability $1/k$ for $j\in\{\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1,\ldots,k\}$}
        \end{cases}

This is the distribution we get when we choose a uniform $j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and set $X_i:=\min\{M,x_i/j)$.  To see how this applies in the proof of \cref{degenerate_and_degree}, let $\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}:=C_p$, and let $x_i:=4d|C_{p,w_i}|$.  In our setting $k=d^a\sqrt{\Delta}\log^b n$ for some constants $a,b>0$, $M=4d\Delta/k$ and $t=ck\log n$ for some (sufficiently large) constant $c$.  The rest of this appendix is devoted to bounding the various quantities that appear in \cref{bernstein} so that we can show that the right-hand side of \cref{bernstein} is $n^{-\Omega(c)}$.    By the end of the appendix, we will have shown that the constants $a=3/2$ and $b=1/2$ satisfy our requirements.

Both the maximum value and the sum of $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are important for us.  Since $C_{p,w_i}\subseteq N_G(w_i)$, we have $x_i\le 4d\deg_G(w_i)\le 4d\Delta$ for all $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$, so $\max\{x_1,\ldots,x_r\}\le 4d\Delta$. The sum can be bounded by
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
    = \sum_{i=1}^n 4d|C_{v,w_i}|
    \le 4d\cdot \sum_{y\in N^+_{H}(p)} |N^+_G[y]|
    \le 16d^2|N^+_{H}(p)|=O(d^3\Delta)
  \enspace .
\]
Then we have
\begin{align*}
  \E(X_i)
  & =\Pr(X_i=M)\cdot M + \sum_{j=\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1}^k \Pr(X_i=j)\cdot\frac{x_i}{j} \\
  & \le\frac{x_i}{kM}\cdot M + \frac{1}{k}\cdot\sum_{j=\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1}^k \frac{x_i}{j} \\
  & \le\frac{x_i}{k} + \frac{1}{k}\cdot\sum_{j=1}^k \frac{x_i}{j} \\
  % & = \frac{x_i}{k} + \frac{x_i}{k}(H_{k}-H_{x_i/M}) \\
  % & \le \frac{x_i}{k}(1+H_{k}) \\
  & \le \frac{x_i(2+\ln k)}{k} \\
  % & = O\left(\frac{x_i}{k}+\frac{x_i\log k}{k}\right) \\
  & = O\left(\frac{x_i\log k}{k}\right) \\
  & = O\left(\frac{x_i\log n}{k}\right)
  \enspace ,
\end{align*}
where the last line comes from the fact that $d,\Delta \le n$.
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  (\E(X_i))^2
  & = O\left(\left(\frac{x_i\log n}{k}\right)^2\right) \\
  & = O\left(\frac{x_i^2\log^2 n}{k^2}\right) \\
  & = O\left(\frac{x_i^2\log^2 n}{d^{2a}\Delta\log^{2b}\Delta}\right) \\
  % & = O\left(\frac{x_i^2\log^{2-2?} \Delta}{d\Delta}\right) \\
  & = O(d^{1-2a}x_i\log^{2-2b} n) \enspace .
\end{align*}
Recall that $M:=4d\Delta/k=4d^{1-a}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{-b}n$. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  \E((X_i-\E(X_i))^2)
  & = \frac{1}{k}\left\lfloor\frac{x_i}{M}\right\rfloor\cdot(M-\E(X_i))^2
    + \sum_{j=\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1}^k \frac{1}{k}\left(\frac{x_i}{j}-\E(X_i)\right)^2 \\
  & \le \frac{x_i}{kM}\left(M^2 + (\E(X_i))^2\right)
    + \sum_{j=\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1}^k \frac{1}{k}\left(\frac{x_i^2}{j^2}+(\E(X_i))^2\right) \\
  & \le \frac{M x_i}{k} + \left(\frac{x_i}{kM}+1\right)\cdot (\E(X_i))^2
      + \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=\lfloor x_i/M\rfloor+1}^k \frac{x_i^2}{j^2} \\
  & \le \frac{M x_i}{k} + \left(\frac{x_i}{kM}+1\right)\cdot (\E(X_i))^2
      +  \frac{1}{k}\cdot\frac{M\pi^2x_i^2}{6 x_i}
     & \text{(since $\sum_{j=a}^{\infty} \tfrac{1}{j^2} \le \tfrac{\pi^2}{6a}$ for $a\ge 1$)} \\
  & = \frac{M x_i}{k}\cdot\left(1+\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{x_i}{kM}+1\right)\cdot (\E(X_i))^2 \\
  & \le \frac{M x_i}{k}\cdot\left(1+\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right) + 2\cdot (\E(X_i))^2   & \text{(since $x_i\le 4d\Delta=kM$)} \\
 & = O(d^{1-2a}x_i\log^{-2b}n) + O(d^{1-2a}\log^{2-2b} n) \\
  & = O(d^{1-2a}x_i\log^{2-2b}n) \enspace .
\end{align*}
Recall that $\sum_{i=1}^r x_i = O(d^3\Delta)$, so
\[
  \E(X)
  = \sum_{i=1}^r \E(X_i)
  = \sum_{i=1}^r O\left(\frac{x_i\log n}{k}\right)
  = O\left(\frac{d^3\Delta\log n}{k}\right)
  = O\left(d^{3-a}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1-b} n\right) \enspace .
\]
and
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^r\E((X_i-\E(X_i))^2)
  = \sum_{i=1}^r O(d^{1-2a}x_i\log^{2-2b} n)
  = O(d^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b} n)  \enspace .
\]
Then \cref{bernstein} gives:
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(X\ge \E(X)+t)
  & = \Pr(X\ge \E(X)+ck\log n) \\
  & \le \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck\log n)^2}{O(d^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{1}{3}Mck\log n}\right) \\
  & = \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck\log n)^2}{O(d^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd\Delta\log n}\right)
    & \text{(since $Mk=4d\Delta$)} \\
  % & = \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck)^2}{O(d^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd\Delta}\right) \\
  & \le \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck\log n)^2}{O(cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd\Delta\log n}\right)
  & \text{(since $c\ge 1$)}\\
  & \le \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck\log n)^2}{O(cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log n}\right)
  & \text{(for $a\le 3/2$)}\\
  & \le \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(ck\log n)^2}{O(cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n}\right)
  & \text{(for $b\le 1/2$)}\\
  & = \exp \left(-\frac{\tfrac{1}{2}(c^2d^{2a}\Delta\log^{2+2b} n)}{O(cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n) + \tfrac{4}{3}cd^{4-2a}\Delta\log^{2-2b}n}\right) \\
  & = \exp \left(-\Omega\left(cd^{4a-4}\log^{4b}n\right)\right) \\
  & \le \exp \left(-\Omega\left(c\log^{4b}n\right)\right)
  & \text{(for $a\ge 1$)}\\
  & \le \exp \left(-\Omega\left(c\log n\right)\right)
  & \text{(for $b\ge 1/4$)}\\
  & = n^{-\Omega(c)} \enspace .
\end{align*}
This calculations assumes that $1\le a\le 3/2$ and that $1/4\le b\le 1/2$.  In particular, $a:=3/2$ and $b:=1/2$ satisfy these requirements.  For any fixed $c$,
\begin{align*}
  \E(X)+t
    & = O(d^3\Delta\log n/k + k\log n) \\
    & = O(d^{3-a}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1-b} n + d^a\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{1+b} n) \\
    & = O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{3/2}n) \enspace .
  % = O(d^{3/2}\log^{1/4} n + d^{3/2}\log^{3/4} n)
  % = O(d^{3/2}\log^{3/4} n)  \enspace .
\end{align*}
Thus, $\Pr(X\ge cd^{3/2}\sqrt{\Delta}\log^{3/2} n) \le n^{-\Omega(c)}$, which completes the proof of \cref{degenerate_and_degree}.
